# FavidPad

This project is created as a part of React learning at Szkola Reacta. It is a simple video platform, which allows you to play your favorite movies, before saved in local database.

## Instalation

## Assumptions

The app shows videos, with given title, and description by custom player. For convenience, it should let users give an url from web url input, like: *https://youtube.com/watch?v=somevideo*, and convert it into right video url, for example: *https://youtube.com/embed/somevideo*.
